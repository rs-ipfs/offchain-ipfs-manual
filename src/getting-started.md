# Getting Started

Our [code base] is currently a well-maintained fork of [paritytech/substrate] and will remain so
until we are confident enough to make a PR proposing its inclusion to Substrate’s core.

In the meantime, and for simplicity’s sake, we are using a Docker image for delivery. Additionally,
we will cover how to use the baseline [substrate-front-end-template] to quickly preview
the functionality.

TODO: Anything else here?
